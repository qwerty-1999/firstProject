					<H1>CRICKET</H1>
					<p> &#8195 &#8195 &#8195 &#8195 &#8195 &#8195 Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 
					20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. 
					The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and 
					fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include 
					being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball 
					after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends 
					and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in 
					international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.</p>

					<H1>FORMS OF CRICKET</H1>
					<p> &#8195 &#8195 &#8195 &#8195 &#8195 &#8195 Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team 
					batting for a single innings of 20 overs, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally 
					cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. 
					In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, 
					which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork 
					core layered with tightly wound string.

					<H1>Origin</H1>
					<p> &#8195 &#8195 &#8195 &#8195 &#8195 &#8195 Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" 
					sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement; others include baseball,
					golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis.In cricket's case, a key difference 
					is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a "wicket gate"
					through which sheep were herded), that the batsman must defend. The cricket historian Harry Altham 
					identified three "groups" of "club ball" games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to and
					fro between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended
					target (the hole); and the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven
					away from it".It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the south-eastern
					counties of England, sometime during the medieval period.</p>

					<p>&#8195 &#8195 &#8195 &#8195 &#8195 &#8195 One possible source for the sport's name is the Old English word "cryce" (or "cricc") meaning a
					crutch or staff. In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from "cryce, Saxon, a stick".
					In Old French, the word "criquet" seems to have meant a kind of club or stick. Given the strong
					medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter
					belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in
					Flanders at the time) "krick"(-e), meaning a stick (crook). Another possible source is the Middle
					Dutch word "krickstoel", meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the 
					long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket. According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European
					language expert of Bonn University, "cricket" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de 
					(krik ket)sen (i.e., "with the stick chase"). Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but 
					also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.
